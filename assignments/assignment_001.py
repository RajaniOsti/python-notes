"""
Example:
1. Create a variable called `name` and assign the value `John Doe` to it.
"""

name = "John Doe"

"""
2. Now create a variable named `age` and assign an integer value to it.
   Use F-string to generate a sentence that explains the name and age.

   Eg: Hi! My name is John Doe and I am 20 years old.

"""
An area of a rectangle is calculated using the formula as follows:

        area = length * width

1. Create variables named `length` and `width` and assign floating point values
   to them.
2. Find out the area of a rectangle and assign it to the variable area_1.
3. perform explicit typecasting of variables `length` and `width` and find out
   the area of the rectangle and assign it to the variable area_2
4. Check the difference between `area_1` and `area_2` and explain why explicit
   typecasting is affecting the original value of the area.

"""
In Geometry, the distance between two points is calculated using the formula
below:

        distance = ( (x2 - x1)**2 + (y2 - y1)**2 )**0.5

1. x1, x2, y1, y2 are integer points.
2. Assign (x1, y1) and (x2, y2) using  multiple assignment. ( eg: x, y = 0, 2 )
3. Square root is represented by an exponentiation by 0.5 or (1/2)th power of
   the number.
4. The final result or the distance is a floating point number.


Please calculate the distance between two points and print the result and assign
it to the variable named `distance` and print the following statement:

        The distance between the points (1,1) and (4,5) is 5.0
